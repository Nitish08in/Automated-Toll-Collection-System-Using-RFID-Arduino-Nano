# Automated Toll Collection System Using RFID & Arduino Nano
# Project Description
This project aims to automate toll tax collection for vehicles using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Vehicles are equipped with RFID tags, which are scanned by an RFID reader installed at the toll booth. The system processes the tag information to automatically deduct the toll amount from the vehicle owner's account, streamlining the toll collection process and reducing manual intervention.

# Objectives
- Automate toll tax collection using RFID technology.
- Reduce traffic congestion at toll booths by expediting the toll collection process.
- Minimize human error and enhance the efficiency of toll collection.
- Implement a cost-effective solution using readily available components like the Arduino Nano.

# Skills and Technologies
**Arduino:** Programming and interfacing with various sensors and modules.
**Circuit Design:** Designing and implementing the circuit for the system.
**Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design:** Designing the PCB layout for the project.
**Soldering:** Assembling the components on the PCB.
**Internet of Things (IoT):** Connecting the system to a network for data transmission and processing.
**Electronics:** Understanding and applying principles of electronics in the project.
